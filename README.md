# -pyScrabble
Single player GUI Scrabble game made with Python and Tkinter.

The colours are customisable, plus there are some fun features like a high score board, cheat code and bonus words.

Here's an example of the game in action:

All files necessary to play are part of the repo (dictionaries and high score file), with folder name the same etc. So the game should be playable as is, if you download everything. Or, alternatively, alter the code and use your own dictionaries and high score system. 

Uses mostly the Python standard library, plus Pandas, NumPy and More Itertools.
